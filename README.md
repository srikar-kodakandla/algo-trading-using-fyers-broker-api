## Seeking Investors for My AI-Driven, Trading Project

I want to make a Deep Learning (Artificial Intelligence) model that will change how we do options selling. If this works, I also want to try it with stocks, other options, foreign markets, and more. For this, I need investors who can support me. Your investment will let me work on this project full time.
As the sole developer of this system, I will have the flexibility to dedicate my full efforts towards this project. With proper funding and support, I aim to create an innovative trading platform and grow it into a successful business.
